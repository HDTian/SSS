# SSS

The SSS framework for nonlinear IV analysis

The SSS framework is for nonlinear causal effect analysis using instrumental variables to  
âœ… testing whether the effect is nonlinear or not   
âœ… estimating the causal effect function of any shape in both nonpara and parametric way  
âœ… investigating the potential effect change-point for both its number and locations 

It contains the three **S** layers:  
ðŸ”§ **S**tratification  
ðŸ”§ **S**calar-on-function or **S**calar-on-scalar regression model  
ðŸ”§ **S**um-of-single-effect fitting  
so that it can work well even with     
ðŸŸ¢ weak IV   
ðŸŸ¢ single binary IV  
ðŸŸ¢ invalid IV   
ðŸŸ¢ complex or unknown confounding pattern  

it is simple, powerful, and can be implemented quickly with quite low computational burden ðŸš€

## Illustration

install in R

``` r
devtools::install_github("HDTian/SSS")
```

``` r
library(SSS)
```

try the following example, or with your data (`Z` is your IV, `X` is your exposure, `Y` is your outcome)

``` r
N <- 50000
set.seed(100)
Z <- rbinom( N , 1 , 0.5 )
U <- rnorm( N , 0 , 1 )
Ex <- rnorm( N , 0 , 1 )
alphaZ<- 0.15
X <-  alphaZ*Z + U + Ex    #very weak instrument
# summary( lm(  X  ~ Z )  )$r.squared   #  < 0.01
Ey <- rnorm( N , 0 , 1 )
Y <- 1.0*(X-1)*(X>1)  + U + Ey  # one change-point located at x=1
```

easily fit with one function

``` r
SSS_res <- SSS(Z,X,Y,x_baseline_used = 0)  # use 0 as the basline value for defining the effect function h(x)
```

see the posterior change-point location via `SSS_res$PIP_plot` (below left), and the estimated effect function $h(x)$ via `SSS_res$hx` (below right) ![Fig1](plots/Fig1.png)

try other examples

``` r
Y <- 2*(X+1)*(X>-1) -2*(X-1)*(X>1)   + U + Ey  # two change-points located at x=-1 and x=1
SSS_res <- SSS(Z,X,Y,x_baseline_used = 0)  
```

call `SSS_res$PIP_plot` (or `SSS_res$hx`) for fitting results ![Fig3](plots/Fig3.png)

you can also try parametric fitting with specified change-point (e.g. according to posterior mean)

``` r
SS_res <- SS(Z,X,Y,x_baseline_used = 0, pos = SSS_res$posterior_mean )
SS_res$hx
```
