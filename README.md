# SSS
The SSS framework for nonlinear IV analysis

This framework contains the three S layers (Stratification; Scalar-on-function regression; Sum-of-single-effect/SuSiE fitting) to conduct powerful nonlinear effect estimation in instrument variable analysis. 

The SSS method can work well even with __weak IV__, __binary IV__, __complex/unknown confounding pattern__, and can be __implemented quickly__ with quite __low computational burden__ ðŸš€
