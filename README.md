# SSS
The SSS framework for nonlinear IV analysis

This framework contains the three __S__ layers (**S**tratification; **S**calar-on-function regression; **S**um-of-single-effect/SuSiE fitting) to conduct powerful nonlinear effect estimation in instrument variable analysis. 

The SSS method can work well, even with 
- [x] _weak IV_
- [x] _binary IV_
- [x]  _complex or unknown confounding pattern_

it is _simple_, _powerful_, and can be _implemented quickly_ with quite _low computational burden_ ðŸš€

Paper: _to be added_

## Illustration
install in R
```r
devtools::install_github("HDTian/SSS")
```
```r
library(SSS)
```

try the following example, or with your data (`Z` is your IV, `X` is your exposure, `Y` is your outcome)
```r
N<-50000
set.seed(100)
Z <- rbinom( N , 1 , 0.5 )
U <- rnorm( N , 0 , 1 )
Ex <- rnorm( N , 0 , 1 )
alphaZ<- 0.15
X <-  alphaZ*Z + U + Ex    # weak instrument
# summary( lm(  X  ~ Z )  )$r.squared   #  < 0.01
Ey <- rnorm( N , 0 , 1 )
Y <- 1.0*(X-1)*(X>1)  + U + Ey  # one change-point located at x=1
```
easily fit with one function
```r
SSS_res <- SSS(Z,X,Y,x_baseline_used = 0)  # use 0 as the basline value for defining the effect function h(x)
```
see the posterior change-point location via `SSS_res$PIP_plot`

see the estimated effect function $h(x)$
