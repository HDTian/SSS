# SSS
The SSS framework for nonlinear IV analysis

This framework contains the three __S__ layers (**S**tratification; **S**calar-on-function regression; **S**um-of-single-effect/SuSiE fitting) to conduct powerful nonlinear effect estimation in instrument variable analysis. 

The SSS method can work well, even with 
- [x] _weak IV_
- [x] _binary IV_
- [x]  _complex or unknown confounding pattern_

it is _simple_, _powerful_, and can be _implemented quickly_ with quite _low computational burden_ ðŸš€

Paper: _to be added_
